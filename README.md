# student-search
A universal cross-platform and modern student search.

This aims to be a unified IITK Student Search under the Programming Club
IIT Kanpur with maximum possible platform support. Current Platforms
being targeted:
* Web
* Android App
* CLI
* Windows Universal App

# Running the scraper
The scraping script can be run by:
```
cd scrape && go run scrape.go
```
Things to improve in the scraping script:
* Use [`pop/soda`](https://github.com/markbates/pop) library for db migrations
* Use [`wspl/creeper`](https://github.com/wspl/creeper) library for cleaner Crawling
